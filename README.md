# CS210 Introduction to Data Science Project

This Individual Project has been done for the CS210 Introduction to Data Science Course in SabancÄ± University Fall 2023-2024


#### Objectives and learning outcomes of the course and project is the following:

- data collection and ethics
- basic statistics and hypothesis testing
- explanatory data analysis
- information extraction from basic data types
-  building machine learning models

---------------------

#### What is the data source: 
- Instagram data has been downloaded for the use of this project. The downloaded data consists of data such as the posts views, posts likes, comments and all specific information that comes to mind. For the efficiency and for the better understanding, post views and post likes of the data are used for giving a meaningful picture of mine. At the end of the proccessing the data, the project enabled me to figure out what kind of accounts that I most interacted with, at what time and what are they all about. i.e sports (basketball, footbal...), art, psychology, music(artist accounts) and etc... 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- This method is used to arrange the data to specific format, prepare for visualization process. This method enabled to get both all account informations and also only one specific account information such as how many times this account got in a interaction with me. 

## Data Visualization
- Bar Chart of Top N Most Frequent Accounts
- Box Plot
- Histogram of Account Name Lengths
- Pie Chart
- Cumulative Area Chart
- Logarithmic Distribution 
- Heatmap
- and more were used to visualize the data


## Machine Learning
- This tehnique is used for training the model for guessing the account names by using the other column data that are present in the dataframe, and also used for guessing the other column data by looking at the account name.


## Hyphotesis
- I am by far more into accounts that are related to basketball than other accounts and I spent so much time in instagram especially in two periods of a day, which are 12 AM and the time between 2 AM and 5 AM. This sleepless situation might represent the intense program of the term.
